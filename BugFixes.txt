Bugs to fix:

1) Input is skipped sometimes - unknown reason
2) Index tiles not aligned correctly - happens with conservatory (example)



matt fixes
1) kitchen and conservatory has no index set causing issues with shortcuts and instance checks
2) the board isnt 100% replecating the csv file, with room tiles missing (this is the reason why each row has diffrent sizes in the grid)
3) special tiles are spawning in null tile locations, breaking the map and making some special tiles impossible to reach
4) /optional/ the game rules state the players should start at the same location (scarlet at a certain tile everytime) also
   player 1 chooses mustard and player 2 chooses scarlet, player 2 should go first.
